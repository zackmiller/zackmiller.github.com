Ben Stiller directs himself as the eponymous lead, a chronic daydreamer who desperately needs an escape from the doldrums of his existence, in _The Secret Life of Walter Mitty_. That escape presents itself in the form of an international quest to save his job by finding a missing photo. Kristen Wiig and Adam Scott join as a love interest and the proverbial hanging axe, respectively.

Without question, this is a feel-good movie. As long as Walter remains in the real world, the script manages a pretty relaxed and genuine sense of humor. Save for a major tonal blemish in the form of a Benjamin Button reference, the dream sequences accomplish a very specific and believable – if over the top – form of wish fulfillment. It’s not a stretch to imagine Walter as a grown up and somewhat downtrodden Scott Pilgrim; at one point we even get the story of how his carefree youth was forcibly replaced by the burden of responsibility.

The visuals in _The Secret Life of Walter Mitty_ are garnering wide praise, and rightly so. The cinematography is fantastic throughout, particularly in the geometric framing of Walter's typical urban surroundings. Each shot has a sort of photographic tidiness to it, as if this world has sprung forth directly from the negatives which Walter spends his days poring over. When Walter finally decides to leave his confines behind, the camera breaks free with him and opens up to the sprawling beauty of landscapes from Greenland to the Himalayas, captured in breathtaking fashion.

Unfortunately, any polish on the film is just that. There isn't much below the surface besides broad platitudes, and there is no clear sense of time – at least not one that jives with the character development we see. Walter hops back and forth across the Atlantic several times in what seems like a mere few days, yet the changes we see in him feel much longer in the making.

Overall, the experience itself feels like yet another of Walter's daydreams: well-meaning and attractively constructed, but only tenuously bound to any sort of story mechanics. Buy into it and you'll enjoy it, just don't expect it to change your life.
