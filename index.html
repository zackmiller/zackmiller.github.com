        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an Associate Yoga Life Coach with training from Wild Abundant Life and am based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I help clients take action and achieve personal growth as part of leading a positive, self-driven life.</p>
        <p>I am currently enrolled in a 200 hour yoga teacher training program and plan to teach restorative and yin yoga.</p>
        <p>I also have a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and am pursuing training in Art Therapy.</p>
        <p>My many interests support my goal of helping clients recognize their personal power. I hope to reach individuals who feel stuck, stressed, or overwhelmed and inspire them to discover the life theyâ€™ve always dreamed about.</p>
