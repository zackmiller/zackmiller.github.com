<section id="bio">
  <p>I'm a software developer in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I use Python to discover, decode, and deliver insights on over 30 years of professional sports data.</p>
  <p>My spare time is spent at the movies, whether in my capacity as a film programmer at <a href="http://carbonarc.ca">Halifax's only independent arthouse cinema</a> or writing for various publications like <a href="http://thefocuspull.com">The Focus Pull Film Journal</a>, <a href="http://photogenie.be">Photog√©nie</a>, <a href="http://cinemascandinavia.com/">Cinema Scandinavia</a>, and <a href="http://shelfheroes.com/">Shelf Heroes</a>.</p>
  <p>I'm always looking for new experiences. If you're looking for someone to hack at your latest software project, ramble aimlessly about cinema, or you just want to chat, you can track me down via <a href="mailto:zack@zackmiller.ca">e-mail</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/zzackmiller">Twitter</a>.</p>
