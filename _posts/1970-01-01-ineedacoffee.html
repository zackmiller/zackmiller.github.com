<section class="description">
	<p><a href="ineeda.coffee">ineeda.coffee</a> is a web app coded in Go. It encourages the sharing of delicious caffeine between friends by grouping users into "coffee pots". Each pot has a daily deadline for orders. After the deadline, all orders for that day are sent to one member of the pot, who picks up the coffee and delivers it to the other members. Selection of the buyer is based on a debt cycle in the system to prevent the same person from always being chosen.</p>
	<p>ineeda.coffee is currently in the early stages of development. Keep an eye out for it to show up online soon!</p>
