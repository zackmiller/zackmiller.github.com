      <h2>What is Yoga Life Coaching?</h2>
      <p>Yoga Life Coaching is, essentially, a conversation. It is both powerful and purposeful. It assists clients in getting clear with what they want, reaches something deep inside themselves, and provides a supportive environment for clients to take both responsibility and action in their lives in order to be their best self.</p>
      <h2>What is Yoga Life Coaching with Charli?</h2>
      <aside>
        <p><em>Do you feel stuck or in a rut?</em></p>
        <p><em>Do you want to live a passionate and empowered life?</em></p>
        <p><em>Do you enjoy self-work?</em></p>
      </aside>
      <p>If you answered yes to any or all of the above, yoga life coaching can benefit you!</p>
      <p>I offer 30 minute coaching sessions via phone call where I create a safe and supportive environment for you to let your guard down, open up, and get to something within you. I will give you my full attention. I will listen intently. I will ask simple but powerful questions. I will give you a firm but gentle nudge towards finding your own answers, clarity, and desires. I will hold you responsible for your thoughts, feelings, and actions. I will help you recognize your true and beautiful self. I will help you recognize what you have to offer this world. I will guide you to take steps towards your dreams. I will offer homework when I see it will benefit you. The purpose of the homework is to get you moving towards the bright and shiny life that is right in front of you.</p>
